<h1>Harvesting the Relevant Webpages</h1>
<hr>
<p>We designed 9 different queries to collect the most relevant web-pages addressing the Family Planning. The different queries have been designed to address as much as possible “nuances” of the Family Planning issues: from the more medical ones to the more daily ones.<br>We qualified and tagged all the webpages accordingly to their contents obtaining three main webpages groups:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Medical Information;</li>
	<li>Contentious Information;</li>
	<li>Natural Family Planning.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following visualizations you can see which query, so which kind of issue formulation, produced more content, which web-site is related to more than one formulation, which domain name is more present and which webpages group is more represented in the corpus.</p>

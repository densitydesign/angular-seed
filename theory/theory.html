        <h1>What Controversies are?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Controversies are one of the most complex phenomena composing the collective and social life. An open and simple definition could be framed as follow: controversies are situations where the actors and parties involved in them “simply” disagree<sup> 1</sup>.
          On many topics these situations are the norm so that exist procedures to settle them out. Take for example cases in legal matters, solved by judges and juries or political disputes, handled by votes, referendums or elections. Nevertheless, when dealing with scientific and technical topics there exist no such procedures available. The word controversy, here, refers as a neutral term, to a shared uncertainty or to «a debate surrounding a technique or scientific fact that has not yet been determined». Its aim is to open the black boxes of techno-scientific truth and observe empirically how they are constructed through a widened and non-linear process of negotiation.
          Techno-scientific controversies involve a wide range of actors, not only human beings and human groups, but also natural and biological elements, industrial, artistic and economic products as well as the very scientific and technical elements. Indeed, every controversy functions as a “hybrid forum,” a space of conflict and negotiation among actors that would otherwise happily ignore each other<sup> 2</sup>.
          Controversies, in this sense, display the social in its most dynamic form. Not only new and surprising alliances emerge among the most diverse actors, but also social unities that seemed indissoluble suddenly break into a plurality of conflicting pieces. Often, they are so specialized that, with very few exceptions, rarely the actors as wells as concerned citizens have an exhaustive knowledge of the case at hand. So they have to rely on a certain trust on non germane-experts and expertise without being able to go inside the details of the proofs.

          Controversies have multiplied and progressively occupied the center of our collective life and the daily controversy proliferation could be taken both a good and bad news. On the one hand, it is good news, because open up the walls of scientific laboratories and expert-assizes letting them visible as consequence of a long-awaited and legitimated demand for democratization of techno-scientific debate. On the other, it is bad news because it partly derives from the increasing ability of lobbies to deliberately feed scientific disputes in order to stall political action.

        <h1>How to explore controversies, dispute and debates?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          To explore and present these socio-technical issues, a specific research method has emerged, called Controversy Mapping, stemming from the Science and Technology Studies<sup> 3</sup> and more precisely from the Actor-Network Theory<sup> 4</sup> (ANT). Controversy Mapping can be defined as a set of techniques for observing and describing, as well as to explore and visualize social issues, especially but not exclusively, socio-technical systems.
          On one hand and from a scholarly point of view, Controversy Mapping is aimed at helping sociologists, anthropologists and other social scientists get insights not into scientific knowledge per se, but rather into the process of gaining knowledge.
          On the other and from a societal perspective, it strives to make the intricacy of scientific debate readable for a larger public. The method has not been conceived as a method of social intervention, unlike crisis management or conflict resolution, it is not meant to solve or channel debates, Controversy Mapping is meant to observe, explore and visualize controversies not to intervene in them.
          The methods is, in principle, absolutely simple since its only rule is “just observe and describe”<sup> 5</sup> following these five movements:
          <ol type="I">
          <li>From statements to debates (what). The goal is to show that statements in controversies are never isolated, but always connected in a dialogue made of endorsements and oppositions;</li>
          <li>From debates to actors (who). The second goal consists in re-attaching the statements to the their speakers. In controversies, every speech act binds alliances and entrenches oppositions. Plotting who shares which argument with whom is therefore the very basis of controversy mapping. Descending from ANT, Controversy Mapping has a very extended definition of actors: scientists and engineers, of course, but also lay experts, activists, decisions-makers and not only individual actors but also collective actors (research institutions, enterprises, lobbies…) and non-human actors (instruments, theories, laws, natural elements…)<sup> 6</sup>;</li>
          <li>From actors to networks (how). Actors, like statements, are never isolated in controversies. The hyphen in actor-network does not encourage researchers to look at one and the other, but to consider actors and networks as one thing<sup> 7</sup>. In controversies, their alliances and oppositions determine the position and the actors’ identity.</li>
          <li>From networks to cosmoses (where). Every controversy is will always be part of other larger meta-controversies and always composed of several sub-controversies. In particular, it is important to show that, though controversies are often fought on the battlefield of technical details, they always oppose conflicting worldviews.</li>
          <li>From cosmoses to cosmopolitics (when). Besides presenting what controversies are about, who fights them, how they join or oppose their forces, it has to shown how all these elements evolve through time.
          By following this “just observe and describe” procedure Controversy Mapping encourage people not to be afraid to open the Pandora’s box of scientific disputes, to follow their actors and deploy their imbroglios, to form one’s own opinion on them and decide which actors require surveillance and which deserve support. Controversy Mapping helps on developing the interpretative skills for dealing with the many controversies on which we are so often asked to take a stand.</li>

        <h1>To whom may it concern?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          On these basis CM does not endorse controversies and disputes closure rather than fostering the development of various tools which, that taken together, may act as a prosthesis for being able to make up one’s mind about the various controversies, debates and disputes:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>For scientists, it would provide an improvement over the available methodologies and tools in order to understand the content of controversies as they extend not only among peers but also among other constituencies, including decision makers, journalists and the public at large. This might in turn stimulate the framing and phrasing of scientific issues in terms which help clarifying points of conflict, including those arising from incomplete or inadequate understanding from other actors;</li>
          <li>For decision makers, both public and private, it would allow on one hand to more readily understand the essence of open controversies and debates among scientists, and therefore the assessment of their potential consequences. In parallel they will be able to obtain an integrated view of the same issues by other affected constituencies, including media representatives, professional bodies, specialists in connected disciplines, and eventually the citizenship at large;</li>
          <li>For communicators, be it on professional media or in open platforms such as blogs, having access to the background of the controversies will allow for an enhanced description of facts and issues to the public;</li>
          <li>For concerned citizens wishing to be better informed, and for society in general, access to an integrated platform which maps the nature and the extent of controversies, will help on one hand alleviate the danger of the communication silos, polarization and information cascades which are observed to form around disputed issues<sup> 8</sup>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Addressing such a wide-range of audiences has to be taken as the norm since controversies cannot be simply ascribed to a public misunderstanding of science<sup> 9</sup>. No controversy can be handled just by spreading scientific consensus through public opinion. Firstly, because the scientific community is, by definition in such a situation, divided, then, and again by definition, because the participation of public actors (institutions, NGOs, activists, corporations...) is already massive. Furthermore, addressing a multiple-in-nature-public is necessary because, following a Deweyan approach<sup> 10</sup>, there is also no such thing as the Public rather than a heterogeneous mixture of ad hoc audiences, coalescing around specific issues.
          Scientific knowledge does not originate in isolation and filter down to the general public: scientific facts are built into social life<sup> 11</sup>, and even more, no discovery or invention, no matter how persuasive or effective, need to be collectively accepted and collectively discussed<sup> 12</sup>. Scientific truth and technological progress are the results of such debates<sup> 13</sup>. Acknowledging that the Sciences are heterogeneous and the Publics are fragmented, led to dismiss the idea of the Science-Society as a percolation of scientific truth through social channels in favor of the effort to comprehend it as a collective work of networking.

        <h1>How to observe and recompose Controversies?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          To observe these networks, constituted around science and technology issues, Controversy Mapping proposes a data-acquisition protocol drawn on the theories and practices of Digital Methods<sup> 14</sup> of research for collecting the traces that the actors leaves behind them on the Web. Digital media are particularly adapted to the heterogeneous character of scientific disputes. On the Web, it can easily retrieve the whole scientific literature concerning any dispute, as well as the full extent of public opinions, commercial patents, institutional positions, journalistic coverage, legal decisions. If there is a way to recompose the fragments of contemporary existence, it certainly involves digital technologies<sup> 15</sup>.
          Once again, we can draw on the philosophy of John Dewey to show the potential of the Web as a debate space<sup> 16</sup>. Because of their capacity to assemble people around discussion themes, digital media are very close to Dewey's ideas<sup> 17</sup>. Not only can all sorts of actors easily and inexpensively express their viewpoints, but also the texture of the Web facilitates the emergence of alliances and oppositions<sup> 18</sup>.

          Digital Methods differ from the “big-data” research programs. The latter, focus on very large data sets pushing social research to the largest possible scale. They are mainly exploratory in orientation being aimed at patterns identification and, sometimes, the nature of these patterns is secondary as compared to a general demonstration of the analytic capacity of the method itself<sup> 19</sup>. Digital methods are, somehow, opposed to big-data methods since their emphasis is not in the magnitude of digital data analyzed while in the critical affordances deployed by the data-acquisition protocol<sup> 20</sup> grounding the opportunities that the digital offers for deriving significant findings from relatively small data-sets. In this sense, Digital methods propose that social research should take advantage of the empirical capacities that are embedded and native of online media. This approach proposes the dominant digital devices, search engines chief among them, can be adapted for purposes of social research that were not possible before. Digital methods are mainly design-driven research methods. Their pillars are the formulation of a researchable question, the delineation of source sets, the continuous development of a narrative linked to the findings. It has to be highlighted that the delineation of source sets here figures as a key feature of research design, going against the big data idea of working with “entire data-sets” solving in this way the problem of generalization.

          To collect their data, Digital methods largely rely on scraping<sup> 21</sup> techniques. By following a series of steps and refinement procedures, usually called pipes, the final formatted, well-ordered and useable data set data are carved out of informational disarrays and unformed mass of online texts. Translating the scraping technique on a speculative level, referring not just to a technique but also to a specific analytic practice, it could be stated that they fulfill the methodological need of not imposing pre-existent categories on “on a fully-formed empirical reality out there”. On the contrary they allow the installation of a continuous movement where “formats and their content emerge simultaneously”<sup> 22</sup>.
          Furthermore, the evidence of this movement can be analyzed to open up a perspective “on digital social research in-the-making” letting emerge the qualitative operations that researchers perform on Web data. The challenge of adapting scraping as a technique of social research is then at least in part a challenge of data selection, curation and visualization.

          To explore the richness of controversies without getting lost in their complexity, it is useful to draw visualizations deploying the alliances and oppositions between actors and ideas active in a dispute. To be sure, it is impossible to reduce the intricacy of a sociotechnical controversy in a single map. It is however possible to capture the richness of a controversy through a series of them<sup> 23</sup>. The aim is to explore, to integrate and depict the enormous informative richness produced by the actors through communication devices able to assemble information and practices even apparently unrelated, in a single optically coherent space. In this sense, Controversy mapping tries to overcome some of the limits of the traditional analytical description. On one side, theoretical remarks should concern the access to data, which, gathered from different fields of study, produce a new relationship between qualitative and quantitative methods; on the other side, empirical experimentations are deployed on the modes through which these spaces are synthesized and translated into narrative devices. These two aspects, only apparently sequential, can be merged into a new dimension that overcomes epistemological borders: beside a strongly codified knowledge are associated new relational and dynamic ones<sup> 24</sup>.

          Besides pragmatic visualizations (meant to support research and scientific reasoning) and artistic visualization (meant to be interpretive and expressive)<sup> 25</sup>, ones produced while engaging with a Controversy mapping campaign could be ascribed to the area of speculative visualization<sup> 26</sup>. Speculative visualization presents socially and politically meaningful data to provoke viewers’ interpretation, to elicit discussions, to envisage possible futures: its ultimate goal is promoting public engagement in social and political issues.

          These visualizations have not to be considered as devices able to provide the reader with definitive answers, but instead as tools to be used in drafting better questions to be asked to the system. Their novelty relies more on their capability of formatting data, rather than their visual aspects. It could be stated that diagrams are like finding engines, rather than searching engines<sup> 27</sup>. Rephrasing, they are able to provide entry points to better examine the faced issues. In such a context to see acquires a key importance: it describes distributions, directions, and dynamics helping the observer in understanding a complex space. The observer is called to read and interpret every single information and data acquired about the controversy, producing a personal and non-linear discursive order. Through these actions, he increases his consciousness with respect to what it observes.
